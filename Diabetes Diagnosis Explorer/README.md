## Diabetes Diagnsis Explorer
In this project, I create an interactive web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on patient data. The app aims to make ML models accessible and easy to interpret for both medical professionals and non-experts.

In the Jupyter notebook file, you will find the codes along with explanations involving these steps: 
- Build interactive web applications with Streamlit and Python
- Train Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifiers using scikit-learn
- Plot evaluation metrics for binary classification algorithms

  By the end of the project, comfortable with using Python and Streamlit to build beautiful and interactive ML web apps (with zero web development experience!) Our web application will allows users to choose what classification algorithm they want to use and let them interactively set hyper-parameter values, all without them knowing to code!
