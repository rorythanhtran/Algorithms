# Machine Learning & Data Mining Algorithms

Testing out Machine Learning and Data Mining algorithms has been an exciting journey in helping me understand data. As a learner, I’ve been exploring different algorithms and models, and this repository is a collection of my personal projects and experiments.

## Projects Included:
This repository contains projects that cover a range of topics, including:
- Data Preprocessing
- Classification Algorithms 
- Regression Models
- Evaluation Metrics

## Languages and Tools:
Most of the code is written in **Python**, but I’ve also included some other languages and libraries where applicable. Some of the common libraries used include:

- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.

## About This Repository:
As a beginner, I’m still learning and experimenting, so you’ll find projects that range from simple exercises to more complex implementations. I’m always open to feedback or suggestions!
