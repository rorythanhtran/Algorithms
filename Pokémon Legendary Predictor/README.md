## Pokémon Legendary Predictor

In this project, I created a machine learning model to predict whether a Pokémon is legendary or not based on its characteristics. Using various features such as stats, type, and other attributes, the model is trained to classify Pokémon into two categories: Legendary and Non-Legendary. 

In the ipynb file, you could see the code along with explanations. Process involves:

- Data Collection: Gathering data from Kaggle.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming features for the machine learning model.
- Data Exploration: Performing an initial analysis of the dataset to better understand the distribution of features, correlations between stats, etc.
- Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features that contribute to accurate predictions. 
- Model Training: Using classification algorithms to train the model and predict the legendary status of a Pokémon.
- Model Evaluation: Comparing models and imporving the accuracy of models.

I had a lot of fun doing this project since it allowed me to combine my love for Pokémon with my growing interest in machine learning. One of my future projects will focus on predicting the outcome of Pokémon battles.
